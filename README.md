## Description

For this assignment I was tasked to generate a javascript based program that uses inquirer to answer questions and place those responces onto an HTML file. Each team member had a specific title, email, id, and something special. Our fearless Manager gets a special office number, the Engineer must show their GitHub page on their card, and our lovely Intern needs must provide us with the school they go to. Once these are all taken into account we slap them all onto a HTML and generate a file! 

Check it out below!
